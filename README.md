# memoBook

## Installing
First you should have got java11. I use the branch called amazon correto from here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html. You also need
to have javafx installed from here https://openjfx.io/.

Second you should have an java editing software like eclipse or IntellJ Idea.

You should have set up javafx in the project run options.

## What is it!
It's a small test application for memo keeping that I developed for a school project. 

## Features
Features that it has got:
  1. memo adding
  2. memo editing
  3. memo deletion
  4. memo file saving and loading
  5. and of course memo reading
 
# Problems
I had a lot of problems when I tried to read the memo and save/load the memos file. It didn't let me change the file path and it didn't let me read the a memo when selected.
It usually portraited an error of an nullpointer it was tedious to try to fix it.

A big problem is that I forgot to git the beginning of the project. I mostly imported the code from the contactsBook into this project at the start so please spare me.

# What I learned
How to make an java application on my own with some reused code. Also how to work with fxml files.
